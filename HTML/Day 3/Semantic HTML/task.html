<!-- Task:
Put together a basic HTML webpage structure with an appropriate use of Semantic HTML, alongside correct use of both the Class and ID attributes.
Your webpage must include an embedded YouTube video and an embedded Google Map.

            <h2>Eating in the cinema?</h2>
            <p>For years, smuggling food and drink into cinemas has felt like a crime, but no more. Our wildest dreams
                have come true, and it has finally been confirmed that, yes, you can officially bring your own snacks to
                watch films in public places.

            <h2>What you can and can't eat in the cinema</h2>
            <p>However, don‚Äôt think you can bring along any food you like. Unless you‚Äôre at one of those fancy cinemas
                that serve meals in your seat, hot food is absolutely out of the question. Hot food can transmit smells
                much more effectively than, say, a grab bag of Cadbury Twirl Bites. Tuck into a burger or a curry in the
                middle of The Batman and you run the risk of offending the rest of the audience.
            </p>
            <p>As an aside, cold food can also smell. South Korean cinemas often have signs banning people from eating
                dried squid during film viewings. So don‚Äôt do that either.</p>
